# final_project
This project aims to emulate Tetris, in which blocks known as tetrominoes slowly fall. The game ends when the block reaches the “vanish zone,” or the top of the playing field. The goal of the game is to either achieve some personal best score for single-player or to last longer than your opponent in multiplayer. This is done through a simple mechanic in which every time a row is completely filled, it’s cleared. Score is gained through clearing rows, in which for every row you clear, you get 100 points. In the multiplayer mode, you can send “garbage,” or an additional row to your opponent, for each row you clear.
